## Agentic Development Principles

### 1. Requirements-Driven Infrastructure
- ✅ **Implement infrastructure based on approved requirements** for operational needs
- ✅ **Validate deployment requirements** align with functional requirements
- ✅ **Ensure environment consistency** supports requirement validation
- ✅ **Reference requirement IDs** in infrastructure code and deployment procedures
- ❌ **Never deploy infrastructure without operational requirement approval**

### 2. Deployment Validation
- ✅ **Validate deployments** meet specified operational requirements
- ✅ **Ensure deployment processes** support specification traceability

- ❌ **Never deploy without validating against acceptance criteria**

### 3. Operational Requirements
- ✅ **Implement monitoring** that validates specification-defined performance requirements
- ✅ **Ensure infrastructure supports** specified load and scalability requirements
- ✅ **Implement security measures** defined in specifications
- ❌ **Never implement operational features without specification backing**
