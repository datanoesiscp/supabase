- ✅ **Ensure code coverage** meets established standards
- ✅ **Test edge cases** defined in acceptance criteria
- ❌ **Never deploy code without adequate test coverage**

## Examples

### Code Comment with Requirement Reference
```javascript
// Implements REQ-LOGIN-001: User authentication with email/password
// Business Rule BR-PASSWORD-001: Password validation requirements
function validatePassword(password) {
    // Must be at least 8 characters with mixed case and numbers
    const minLength = password.length >= 8;
    const hasUpper = /[A-Z]/.test(password);
    const hasLower = /[a-z]/.test(password);
    const hasNumber = /\d/.test(password);
    
    return minLength && hasUpper && hasLower && hasNumber;
}
```
